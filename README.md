# Movie Genre Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the genre(s) of a movie based on its **plot summary**. The dataset consists of movie descriptions and their corresponding genres, making it a **multi-label text classification problem**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Genre Classification Dataset IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)
- **Features:**
  - `title`: Movie title
  - `summary`: Movie plot summary (text-based feature)
  - `genres`: Labels (multi-label classification)
- **Types of Datasets:**
  - IMDb Dataset
  - Movie Dataset
  - Merged Dataset

## Approach
We will use **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** and **Machine Learning classifiers** to predict movie genres from text summaries. The key steps include:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning text (removing stopwords, punctuation, special characters)
- Tokenization
- Feature extraction using:
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
  - **Word Embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText)

### 2. Model Selection
We will experiment with multiple classification algorithms:
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Transformer-based models** (BERT, DistilBERT) [optional]

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- Train multiple models using **TF-IDF and word embeddings**
- Evaluate performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**
- Use **multi-label classification metrics** (e.g., Jaccard similarity, Hamming loss)

## Experiment Tracking and Version Control
### **DVC (Data Version Control)**
- **Why?** Keeps track of data versions, pipelines, and ML models.
- **Planned Usage:**
  - Track dataset versions
  - Manage preprocessed data and features
  - Version control for trained models

### **MLflow (Experiment Tracking & Model Registry)**
- **Why?** Logs parameters, metrics, and trained models.
- **Planned Usage:**
  - Track hyperparameter tuning
  - Log model performance and comparisons
  - Store trained models for deployment
